<p>If your systems can't scale, you are FUBAR. If your code is just for testing, its FOO=BAR. And if you wait until 2008 to finally register a domain name for blogging about technology, you're FEWBAR.com</p>
<p>One can expect to see articles primarily focused on what I (<a href="http://spamaps.org/">Clint Byrum</a>) do for a living. That is, making technology run reliably and scale cost effectively. These days readers can expect a focus on infrastructure as a service, especially <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>.</p>
