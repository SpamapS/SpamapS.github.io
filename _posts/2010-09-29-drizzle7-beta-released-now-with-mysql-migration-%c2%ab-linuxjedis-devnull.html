<p>Drizzle is a project that is near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p>To sum it up, Drizzle took all that was really good in MySQL, cut out all that was mediocre, and replaced some of it with really good stuff. The end product is, I think, something that is leaner, should be more stable, and definitely more flexible.</p>
<p>So go check out the beta! I guess I should use Andrew's migration tool and see if I can migrate this blog to drizzle. :)</p>
