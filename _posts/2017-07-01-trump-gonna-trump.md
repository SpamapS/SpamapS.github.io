I usually don't post much about politics here, but this week our President
was [caught looking pretty silly][wapo], and I feel like it's worth
commenting on.

Just do the thought experiment: Imagine if Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama
or John Kasich made something like this and put it up anywhere. Those
who thought highly of them would think it was a joke. Any of them would
likely come out immediately and explain that it was in fact a joke and
most of us would have a laugh at it. It's so out of character, it would
just be laughable to anyone who looks at those individuals as good people.

But no matter what they did of course those who thought negatively of them
already would call it narcissism of the highest form and decry them as
purveyors of fake news. This would blow over pretty quickly, because none
of these people have been pointing fingers at their critics and calling
them fake news. But it would certainly serve to enrage their detractors.

The reason this doesn't bother The [45th President of the United
State][pussygrabber]'s supporters is that _they already accepted that
he has no integrity_. They see this and just go "This guy. What will he
do next?" But if you're holding him to the fire, it just tickles that
healthy confirmation bias that he is the end of our democratic traditions
and a truly terrifying individual who is burning down the reputation of
the presidency one [stupid tweet][covfefe] at a time.

Usually we have a fringe of people who treat the president this
way. Either it's the far left protesting Bush 43 over Iraq and spending
cuts, or the far right protesting Obama over immigration and climate
change policies. Grow a thick skin Mr. President, whoever you are.

But now we have [a large majority of moderates joining the far left in
opposing this president][fivethirtyeight]. That only serves to entrench
his supporters more. They see themselves as outsiders who finally got
their guy in. So don't be surprised when his supporters laugh off these
stunts. They don't care because they just want you to acknowledge that
they won and you lost, and he cares about them and their issues. They
don't mind that he's embarrassing. As long as he's sticking it to you, the
elites and their supporters who have been sticking it to them for years.

IMO, just ignore all of that. We've made our piece against this man,
and now it's time to get down to fixing the damage and building a better
society that is more resilient to these problems.

How? We start by taking time to support strong leaders who will restore
the respect and dignity of the office and the nation. [Support legislators
that will amend the constitution][mayday] to reverse the influence
corporations have over elections so we aren't stuck with fund raisers and
reality TV stars as our only choices.

And finally, when our friends, family, and neighbors who supported Trump
come back in 2020 like a screaming horde of vikings intent on burning
down the last vestiges of civil society: don't hate them. Don't belittle
them. Don't even shout at them. Just be ready with the only real defense
any of us have: our vote.
