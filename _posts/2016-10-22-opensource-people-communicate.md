As I sit here preparing to cross the Atlantic, I am pondering on what
we'll do [in barcelona](https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/).

This will be my... (stopping to count on fingers.. running
out of fingers...)  11th Summit. Back in the Essex days, I was
communicating about [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/) whilst working for
[Canonical](http://www.canonical.com).  It was a fantastic experience
to see some of the same communication methods we had used at [Ubuntu
Developer Summits](http://uds.ubuntu.com/), and new ones, coming together
to form this massive community.


This will be the last summit where we ask _every_ technical contributor
to join the fray. An evolution of the process is under way, which has been
called the [Project Teams Gathering](http://www.openstack.org/ptg). So
this may be the last time we do it the way it has always been done,
with technical contributors mingling with business folks at the
OpenStack Conference. There are some [concerns about this][concerns],
some even [expressed by me][my_concerns]. But I trust those who have
been formulating this plan to be dilligent at iterating on it to improve
our throughput.


And the reason I trust them is that I have seen one constant throughout
successful Open Source contributors. We all communicate. I take it for
granted how well we actually communicate, given how distributed we are,
and how few shared objectives we have. But I think what separates a
pet project on github from an Ansible or OpenStack sized project is
contributors who communicate early, and communicate often.


So, I am very much looking forward to this upcoming summit. I expect
that we will all do our best to communicate by listening, recording,
reflecting, and adding our voics. But I am also quite excited to see
how the new format works out not only at the PTG in February, but also the
[next Summit in Boston](https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/).
