<p>One of my favorite bloggers, Peter over at Percona/MySQL Performance Blog, <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/11/10/thoughs-on-innodb-incremental-backups/">has thrown down the gauntlet</a>. Basically saying that it would be fairly trivial to write an incremental InnoDB backup tool.</p>
<p>If you see me, and I haven't run up to you and told you that I am writing/have written an amazing InnoDB incremental backup tool, I give you permission to make fun of me. This sounds like a fun, interesting project that will challenge me and sort of scratches an itch I have, which is, faster MySQL backups.</p>
