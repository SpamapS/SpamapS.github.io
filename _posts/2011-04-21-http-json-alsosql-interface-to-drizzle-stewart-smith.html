<p><a href="http://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2011/04/21/http-json-alsosql-interface-to-drizzle/">HTTP JSON AlsoSQL interface to Drizzle | Ramblings</a>. - This is what I'm talking about when I say Drizzle will be for HTTP what Apache was for MySQL. Its hyper flexible and quite performant. Stewart is a quite gifted programmer, but look how easy it was to integrate a JSON library and libevent into the server on a whim.</p>
<p>As a sysadmin with LAMP shops, I always had to stop innovating around the MySQL part of it. Linux I could hack on, apache I could hack on, and PHP/Perl/Python were built to be hacked on. But MySQL was always difficult beyond a few clever UDF's.</p>
<p>I'm waiting for somewhere to adopt Drizzle and really start running wild with the plugins. Should be interesting!</p>
