<p>After a few weeks of working hard on it, myself and Patrick Galbraith have gotten DBD::drizzle working using the new <a href="https:&#47;&#47;launchpad.net&#47;libdrizzle">libdrizzle<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Patrick is uploading it to CPAN right now, but you can get the latest version <a href="https:&#47;&#47;code.launchpad.net&#47;~clint-fewbar&#47;dbd-drizzle&#47;trunk">in my Launchpad tree<&#47;a>. I have tested it running MogileFS as well, which seems to work perfectly.</p>
<p>For now its just a near direct port from libmysqlclient to libdrizzle.. but we are planning on revamping a few of the things to handle multiple connections and fully non-blocking I&#47;O. w00t.</p>
