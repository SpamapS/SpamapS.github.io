<p>After having so much fun at the MySQL/Percona 2009 conference, I've decided to self-fund my trip to <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009">O'Reilly OSCON 2009</a>.</p>
<p>My first step in this was adding banner ads to fewbar.com. I'll also be juggling swords and old 386 laptops on Venice Beach on the weekends just in case my traffic doesn't increase.</p>
