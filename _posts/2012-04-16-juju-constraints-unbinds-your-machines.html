<p>This week, <a href="https:&#47;&#47;lists.ubuntu.com&#47;archives&#47;juju&#47;2012-April&#47;001426.html">William "I code more than you will ever be able to" Reade announced that Juju has a new feature called 'Constraints'.<&#47;a></p>
<p>This is really, really cool and brings juju into a new area of capability for deploying big and little sites.</p>
<p>To be clear, this allows you to abstract things pretty effectively.</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<p><code>juju deploy mysql --constraints mem=10G<br />
juju deploy statusnet --constraints cpu=1<&#47;code></p>
<p>This will result in your mysql service being on an extra large instance since it has 15GB of RAM. Your statusnet instances will be m1.small's since that will have just 1 ECU.</p>
<p>Even cooler than this is now if you want a mysql slave in a different availability zone:</p>
<p><code>juju deploy mysql --constraints ec2-zone=a mysql-a<br />
juju deploy mysql --constraints ec2-zone=b mysql-b<br />
juju add-relation mysql-a:master mysql-b:slave<br />
juju add-relation statusnet mysql-a<&#47;code></p>
<p>Now if mysql-a goes down</p>
<p><code>juju remove-relation statusnet mysql-a<br />
juju add-relation statusnet mysql-b<&#47;code></p>
<p>Much and more is possible, but this really does make juju even more compelling as a tool for simple, easy deployment. <em>Edit: fixed ec2-zone to be the single character, per William's feedback.<&#47;em></p>
