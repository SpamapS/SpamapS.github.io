<p>If you came here between April 28 and about an hour ago, you got a "couldn't connect to database" error. Oops! Seems my limited memory EC2 instance got a little overwhelmed by php processes and decided the db server, drizzled, should die to make more room for PHP. Ooops! Time to drop pm.max_children.</p>
<p>I don't have any monitoring setup for the site, so I just now figured it out. Until I get proper monitoring, I've installed this fancy bit of duct-tape upstart magic:<br />
<code><br />
start on stopping<br />
task<br />
script<br />
  env | mail -s "$JOB is stopping!" me@myemail.com<br />
end script<br />
<&#47;code></p>
<p>What does this do? Well is emails me whenever upstart gives up respawning something, or I manually stop a service.</p>
<p>Its not monitoring. I need monitoring. But this is a nice little hack to prevent a regression while I figure that out.</p>
