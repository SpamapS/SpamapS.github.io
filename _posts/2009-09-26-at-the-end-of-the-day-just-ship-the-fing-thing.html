<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html">This article about "Duct Tape Programmers"</a> excerpts <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219483?ie=UTF8&tag=joelonsoftware&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430219483">another article with interviews from great coders</a>. I just had to share this fantastic quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski">Jamie Zawinski</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Yeah,” he says, “At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! It’s great to rewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the third time it’ll actually be pretty. But that’s not the point—you’re not here to write code; you’re here to ship products.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm a big fan of "the proper amount of abstraction", but I think its important to remember the scope of each thing we're working on. Rock on jwz.</p>
