<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.joelonsoftware.com&#47;items&#47;2009&#47;09&#47;23.html">This article about "Duct Tape Programmers"<&#47;a> excerpts <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;1430219483?ie=UTF8&tag=joelonsoftware&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430219483">another article with interviews from great coders<&#47;a>. I just had to share this fantastic quote from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Jamie_Zawinski">Jamie Zawinski<&#47;a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! It&rsquo;s great to rewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the third time it&rsquo;ll actually be pretty. But that&rsquo;s not the point&mdash;you&rsquo;re not here to write code; you&rsquo;re here to ship products.&rdquo;<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of "the proper amount of abstraction", but I think its important to remember the scope of each thing we're working on. Rock on jwz.</p>
