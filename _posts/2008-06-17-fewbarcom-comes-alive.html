<p>I've been promising for some time to create a blog about Technology, Life, and mischief in general. Fewbar.com is just my good-faith first step in getting that done. Only time will tell whether this will be the next clearing house for genius technical advice, or just another empty Wordpress blog on the web.</p>
<p>While you wait patiently for the amazingly useful and poignant posts to start rolling out, please do take a moment to brighten everybody in the office's day with this <a href="http://kovaya.com/miscellany/2007/10/insert-coin.html">ingenious little perl script</a>. Its especially useful for informing your users that they are "TREE KILLERS!", or for passing along any ex-girlfriends' phone numbers to the other men in the office.. you know.. in the interest of making sure she can find a date.</p>
