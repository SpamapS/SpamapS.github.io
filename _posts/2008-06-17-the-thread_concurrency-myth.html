excerpt: "Just a few weeks ago, I found out that thread_concurrency's purported magical
  effects at correcting <a href=\"http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=15815\">MySQL's
  concurrency limitations</a> (especially in 4.1) were something of a myth. It was
  <a href=\"http://lists.mysql.com/mysql/208874\">a post on mysql's lists</a> that
  alerted me to this. Apparently it only works on Solaris, Linux's threading library
  ignores this parameter completely. This is not to be confused with innodb_thread_concurrency,
  which is quite useful in controlling the flow of transactions through InnoDB. I
  think the problem really lies in the fact that the default my.cnf example configs
  tell us to set thread_concurrency to the number of CPU's*2. They fail to mention
  that this only matters on Solaris, though <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/server-system-variables.html#option_mysqld_thread_concurrency\">the
  manual is quite clear</a>.\r\n"

I think I set this parameter to 1, 4, and 8 trying to see if it would affect things positively or negatively on quite a few 4.1 boxes. I always just sort of assumed it was going to help prevent any sort of snowballing of server load if it ever got hit hard.</p>
<p>Yet another example where its important to RTFM!</p>
