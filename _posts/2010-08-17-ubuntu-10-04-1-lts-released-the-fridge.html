<p>This is pretty cool. I know as a system administrator, I never wanted to run .0 anything. So 10.04 is really like 10.04.0, and means "let somebodye lse find the bugs.".</p>
<p>Well 10.04.1 means that the more conservative administrators can at least have a reasonable expectation that it will be even more stable than it was on release day in April.</p>
<p>If you're already running Ubuntu servers, btw, check this out:</p>

<p>Hit it and be counted as a server user. Pretty amazing how many little orange circles there are all over the world.</p>
<p>For those of you who've been telling me that my blog posts sound like "gleep ork boog florg", a quick primer:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu<&#47;a> is an operating system, like Mac OS X or Windows (except more awesomer).</p>
<p>10.04 was their April, 2010 release (10 == 2010 04 == april).</p>
<p>LTS means Long Term Support. This means that the people who maintain Ubuntu will support this release for 3 - 5 years (depending on the context.. 3 for desktops, 5 for servers).</p>
<p>10.04.1 is a fixed up release, mainly marking the release of updated CD images for installing. If you install 10.04 and choose automatic updates, you're already on 10.04.1 before the release.</p>
