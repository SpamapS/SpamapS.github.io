<p>The great thing about working in Open Source is that often one can drive a single mission through multiple organizations to an end goal that makes the most sense for the community. I hope that some find the changes I made to OpenStack while at HP useful both inside HP, and outside. They were a fantastic employer and I'm eager to see where HP Enterprise goes from here.</p>
<p>That said, I'm extremely excited to be joining IBM to work on OpenStack from a different angle. We'll be doing some really cool things, and I just can't wait to get the ball rolling! In fact I won't have to wait as today is my first day, and I'm here in North Carolina at the Research Triangle Park to begin my assimilation into the borg.. er.. to be oriented for employment at IBM.</p>
